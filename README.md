> [!NOTE]
> If you click on add, subtract, multiply, divide, clear, or delete and still have your mouse hovered over the button you clicked on, and then you try to do calculations through key presses, you will get an incorrect output. To fix this, after you click those buttons, click on anywhere on the screen that is not the buttons.

> [!NOTE] 
> I tweaked some features, such as fixing the bug where the calculator would disappear when you press a dot when the calculator is empty, changed the calculator's design, made it responsive, and made key presses do calculations such as adding numbers, subtracting, etc.
