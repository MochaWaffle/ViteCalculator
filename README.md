# ViteCalculator
Most of the code is from Web Dev Simplified React Calculator video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8. 
I tweaked some fetures such as fixing the bug where the calculator would dissapear when you press dot when the calculator is empty, changed the design of the calculator, made it responsive, and made key presses 
do calculations such as adding numbers, subtracting, etc. 

Key Press Binds:

Enter: "Enter"/"="

Add: "+"

Subtract:"-"

Multiply: *

Divide: "/" or "\"

Dot: "."

Clear: "Delete:

Delete (single digits): "Backspace"

Note: If you click on add, subtract, multiply, divide, clear, or delete and still have your mouse hovered over the button you clicked on and then you try to do calculations through key presses, you will
get an incorrect output. To fix this, after you click those buttons, click on anywhere on the screen that is not the buttons.
